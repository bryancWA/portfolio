      <p id="about-paragraph"> After honing my international non-profit NGO interning skills in the eastern part of Bolivia, I found myself with a scrub brush in hand, on my hands and knees cleaning the fish hold of a twenty-seven foot bow-picker fishing boat, in a remote Alaskan bush town.
      Since that fateful transition, I've driven semi-trucks, dug ditches, pitched fish, barked orders, received orders, operated heavy machinery, pulled a fifty-three foot trailer through downtown Oakland, and drove my Honda CR-V the entire stretch between San Diego, CA, and Whittier, AK. I attended Willamette University College of Law and worked in the legal industry for several years until I was drawn to the creativity offered by the software industry.
      After flirting with Javascript since 2017 I decided it was time to take the plunge and I joined the ranks of the Hack Reactor bootcamp. The love story has continued with Node.js, React, SQL, and I am super excited about interacting with other technologies that allow me to check the creative box. I am the sum of my experiences, and I wouldn't change a single one.
